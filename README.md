# crystal-collector
a number matching game with hidden values

The player is presented with a randomly selected goal number to reach by clicking on 4 crystals, each of which adds a different randomly selected number to the player's score.

The player loses if their score goes higher than the goal or they concede. At which time, the game resets.
